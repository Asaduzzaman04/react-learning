  /*
    The Context API in React facilitates state management and data sharing across components without the need for manual prop passing at every level. It enables the creation of a central context that holds data, allowing any component to access it, regardless of its position in the component tree.

This approach addresses the challenges of "prop drilling," where data must be passed down from parent to child components, which can become cumbersome in larger applications. By using the Context API, developers can share data globally without repetitive prop passing, making it particularly useful for managing global states like user authentication status or theme settings.
